For this PA, I pretty much followed the basic directions for making the Card and Deck class.
The Card class is self explanatory; in the Deck class I used the shuffle method from the Wiki article.

In the Casino class, I tried to be as user friendly as possible. I made sure everything was explained,
and that everything that was happening in the game was being updated for the user to see.
I made the betting system simple, where the user would be kicked out of the casino if they
were at $0, but otherwise had the option to bet as much as they had.
